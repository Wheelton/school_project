- It's my school project I had to do on the practics. It is code for a minigame created in Java, inspired by a toy named "Rubik's cube" and a game "Simon says".
- At the beginning, you have 5 fields of different colour sorted by a random algorithm, remember them:
- -Top,
- -Right,
- -Bottom,
- -Left,
- -Center.
- -Every single start you'll have different order of colours.
- -After 10 seconds this order of colours is sorted again.
- -Goal is to match colours with fields like in the beginning.
- -Once you've put colours correctly, the game stops.
- -Controls:
- ⬅ - to change colour of the left field
- ⬆ - to change colour of the top field
- ⬇ - to change colour of the bottom field
- ➡ - to change colour of the right field

-To start this game, import file or code to the file working with Java compiler
